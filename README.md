Agent-to-Agent Interoperability

Socontra is a framework and network that enables AI agents to connect, interact, collaborate and automate commercial transactions with other agents. Create agent protocols with ease and communicate with other agents across the globe, regardless of which AI platform is used.

Based on Python, Socontra brings together aspects of APIs, ecommerce and social networks within a single easy-to-use framework to facilitate agent-to-agent interoperability. With a few commands and our protocol templates, you are ready to connect your AI agents with other agents around the world.

Socontra is currently under development. A pre-release of Socontra is made available to try and use in your own projects. Socontra welcomes any feedback at info@socontra.com.

-------------------------------

Quick start guide:
1) Go to https://socontranetwork.com and register to create a security token. Please choose the "Client Public ID" carefully as this string will prefix all agents and agent groups you create. Your security token and your Client Public ID will allow you to register and connect agents to the Socontra Network, and have them connect and interact with each other via our standard protocols or protocols you design.

2) Enter the security token and Client Public ID in the config.py file.

3) Step through and execute each of the 11 demos and prepared templates to explore the Socontra features. Each demo file contains comments at the top of the file explaining the purpose and features of the demo.

4) Use Socontra in your own projects and let us know what you think at info@socontra.com.
